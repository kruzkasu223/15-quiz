# 15/27-quiz

This project is all about creating interactive quiz application. (but it'll be
just static, due to time constraints)

I will use [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) to initiate the project and
will use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and for styling
[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).
Quiz questions are taken from
[https://www.proprofs.com/quiz-school/topic/web-development](https://www.proprofs.com/quiz-school/topic/web-development)
with some modification.
